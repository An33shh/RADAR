# RADAR - Real-time Analysis & Detection of Adversarial Resources

**A C# threat intelligence aggregation platform for correlating IOCs across multiple sources and identifying infrastructure pivots between threat actors.**

## üéØ Project Overview

RADAR is designed to automate the collection, correlation, and analysis of threat intelligence from multiple open-source feeds. The platform enables security researchers to identify previously unknown relationships between threat actors through shared infrastructure analysis.

## üèóÔ∏è RADAR v1.0 Features

**Enterprise-Grade Architecture:**
- Complete dependency injection container with service registration
- Comprehensive configuration management with secure local overrides
- Professional logging framework with structured output
- Multi-threaded threat feed orchestration
- Robust error handling and rate limiting

**Threat Intelligence Collectors (Fully Implemented):**
- **AlienVault OTX** - Community threat intelligence and IOC feeds
- **Abuse.ch MalwareBazaar** - Malware samples and hash indicators  
- **MITRE ATT&CK** - Tactics, techniques, and threat actor profiles

**Advanced Correlation Engine:**
- Cross-source IOC validation (same indicators from multiple feeds)
- Temporal correlation analysis (coordinated threat activity detection)
- Threat actor attribution clustering
- Malware family relationship mapping
- Infrastructure pivot detection (shared C2 infrastructure)
- Confidence scoring algorithms

**Comprehensive Data Models:**
- `ThreatIndicator` - Complete IOC representation with metadata
- `ThreatActor` - Threat actor profiles with TTPs and attribution
- `CorrelationResult` - Analysis findings with confidence scoring
- `InfrastructurePivot` - Shared infrastructure detection between actors

**Professional Reporting System:**
- JSON reports for programmatic analysis
- CSV exports for spreadsheet analysis
- Markdown executive summaries
- Infrastructure pivot analysis reports
- Session-based data storage and historical analysis

### üîí Security Features
- Secure configuration management (API keys in local files only)
- Comprehensive .gitignore for sensitive data protection
- Environment variable support for production deployments
- API key validation and health checking

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio
- API keys for threat intelligence sources

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/An33sh/RADAR.git
   cd RADAR
   ```

2. **Set up secure configuration:**
   ```bash
   cd RADAR.Core
   
   # Copy the template to create your local config
   cp appsettings.json appsettings.local.json
   
   # Edit appsettings.local.json with your API keys
   # The main appsettings.json has empty API key fields for security
   ```

3. **Get API Keys:**
   - **AlienVault OTX**: Register at https://otx.alienvault.com and get your API key
   - **Abuse.ch**: Request API access at https://bazaar.abuse.ch/api/
   - **MITRE ATT&CK**: No API key required (public data)

4. **Update your configuration:**
   ```json
   {
     "AppConfig": {
       "ThreatFeeds": [
         {
           "Name": "AlienVault_OTX",
           "ApiKey": "YOUR_OTX_API_KEY_HERE"
         },
         {
           "Name": "AbuseCH_MalwareBazaar",
           "ApiKey": "YOUR_ABUSE_API_KEY_HERE"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```
